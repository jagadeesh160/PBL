      An entertainment manager is responsible for booking and supervising events for a corporation. You serve as a liaison between
       the booking entity and the performers. The role differs from an entertainment business manager, as you are working for the 
       venue or corporation, as opposed to the performers. Entertainment management focuses on promotion, entrepreneurship and 
       related business skills in the entertainment, sports and event management industries. Courses may also cover current trends
       in creative industries such as theater, cinema, music and television.
